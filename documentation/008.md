## Introduction

In Linux, every file and directory has a set of permissions that determine who can read, write, or execute it. The `chmod` command (short for "change mode") is used to modify these permissions.

---

## Understanding File Permissions

Each file or directory has **three sets of permissions**:
1. **Owner** – the user who owns the file
2. **Group** – users who are members of the file's group
3. **Others** – all other users

Each set can have the following permissions:
- `r` (read)
- `w` (write)
- `x` (execute)

---

## Permission Types

| Symbol | Description          |
|--------|----------------------|
| `r`    | Read permission       |
| `w`    | Write permission      |
| `x`    | Execute permission    |
| `-`    | No permission         |

---

## Symbolic Representation

A file's permission can be viewed using `ls -l`:

```bash
$ ls -l myfile.sh
```
Output

-rwxr-xr-- 1 user group 123 Aug 1 10:00 myfile.sh

Breakdown:

- : type (file)

rwx : owner permissions (read, write, execute)

r-x : group permissions (read, execute)

r-- : others permissions (read)

**Numeric (Octal) Representation**

Permissions can be represented with numbers:

Symbol	Value
| Symbol | Value |
| ------ | ----- |
| `r`    | 4     |
| `w`    | 2     |
| `x`    | 1     |


Add values for combined permissions:
| Permission | Value |
| ---------- | ----- |
| `rwx`      | 7     |
| `rw-`      | 6     |
| `r--`      | 4     |
| `---`      | 0     |

## Using chmod

**Symbolic Mode**

```bash
chmod [who][+/-/=][permission] file
```
who: u (user), g (group), o (others), a (all)

+: add, -: remove, =: set exact

Examples:

```bash
chmod u+x script.sh      # Add execute for owner
chmod go-w file.txt      # Remove write for group and others
chmod a=r file.conf      # Everyone gets read only
```

**Numeric Mode**
```bash
chmod [mode] file
```

Example
```bash
chmod 755 script.sh
```

This sets:

7 (owner) = rwx

5 (group) = r-x

5 (others) = r-x

**Changing Permissions Recursively**
To change permissions for a directory and all its contents:

```bash
chmod -R 755 myfolder/
```

Examples
```bash
chmod 600 secret.txt        # Owner can read/write, others none
chmod 644 report.txt        # Owner rw, others r
chmod 700 private/          # Only owner can access
chmod u+x myscript.sh       # Make script executable by owner
chmod o-rwx data.txt        # Remove all permissions for others
```

**Common chmod Values**

| Mode | Meaning                         |
| ---- | ------------------------------- |
| 777  | Everyone can read/write/execute |
| 755  | Owner rwx, others rx            |
| 700  | Only owner rwx                  |
| 644  | Owner rw, others r              |
| 600  | Only owner rw                   |
