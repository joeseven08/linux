Linux is a free and open-source operating system based on Unix. It is widely used on servers, desktops, mobile devices (like Android), embedded systems, and more.

🐧 What Makes Linux Special?

✅ Key Features:

- Open-source – anyone can view, modify, and distribute the code
- Free – no license fees required
- Secure – strong permission model and widespread use in security-critical systems
- Stable – powers the majority of servers and cloud infrastructure
- Customizable – can be adapted for any use case, from supercomputers to routers

🛠 Linux Components
- Kernel – the core that interacts directly with hardware
- Shell – the command-line interface (e.g., Bash)
- File System – hierarchical file structure (everything is a file)

- CentOS / AlmaLinux / Rocky Linux – RHEL-compatible free versions
- Arch Linux – minimal, DIY approach
- Kali Linux – for penetration testing and security research
