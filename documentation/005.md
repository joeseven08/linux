# Changing an IP Address

Usually the IP is set during the installation.However, if there is a need to change the IP, you can check on this directory first.

```bash
cd /etc/sysconfig/Network-Scripts
```

However, if you cannot find any file that has the same name with the ethernet such as ens0p1, ens0p3 etc, then go to this directory:

```bash
cd /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections
```

You will find out the configuration for each NIC connected to your virtual machine.

Open the file you want to edit.

Edit the IP address.

This is the example.

Click save

Restart the NIC. Examples:

```bash
nmcli connection down 'Wired connection 1'
```

```bash
nmcli connection up 'Wired connection 1'
```

Check again by running command

```bash
nmcli 'Wired connection 1'
```

or

```bash
ip addr
```

The IP address should change.
