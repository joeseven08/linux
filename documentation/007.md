# Wild Cards (*, ?, ^, [])

 A wildcard is a character, as defined in the Linux dictionary, that can be used as a substitute for any character in a class of characters during a search.

There are many wildcards, but the most basic ones are three:
- The asterisk (*), which I use most of the time, also referred to as a star. A star represents zero or more characters, matching anything that fits in that placeholder.
- The question mark (?), which represents a single character.
- Brackets ([]), which represent a range of characters.

**Practical Example: Creating Multiple Files**
I want to create nine files with names such as ABCD1 and XYZ, incrementing the number from 1 through 9. 

```bash
touch ABCD{1..9}-XYZ
```

**Using the Asterisk (*) Wildcard**

To list every file name that starts with ABC, you can use the command:

```bash
ls ABC*
```

**Using the Question Mark (?) Wildcard**

The question mark represents a single character. For example, to list files where the second character is B, the third is C, the fourth is D, and the rest can be anything, use:

```bash
ls ?BCD*
```

**Using Brackets ([]) Wildcard**

Brackets allow you to specify a set or range of characters to match. For example, to list files that have either the letter C or D in a specific position, use:

```bash
ls [ap]*
```
This command lists all files starting with either a or p. You can include multiple characters inside the brackets to match any one of them.

**Removing Files Using Wildcards**
```bash
rm *xy*
```
