# Find & Locate

## 🔍 find
How it works: Searches the filesystem in real-time by traversing directories.

Slower: Because it checks each directory and file as it goes.

Accurate: Shows the current state of the filesystem.

Syntax example:
```bash
find /home -name "file.txt"
```

Can filter by:
- Name
- Size
- Date modified
- Permissions
- Owner
- Type (file, directory, etc.)

---
## 📇 locate
How it works: Searches a pre-built database of files (usually updated daily by updatedb).

Faster: Because it just searches the database.

May be outdated: If the file was created/deleted recently and updatedb hasn’t run.

Syntax example:

```bash
locate file.txt
```
Needs **updatedb**: To keep the database fresh, run:

```bash
sudo updatedb
```
