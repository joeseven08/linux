# Filters/ Text Processing Commands

---

## Cut

The cut command in Linux is a handy tool used to extract sections from each line of input — typically from a file or piped output. It’s great for grabbing specific columns, fields, or character ranges.

It’s often used when you want to “slice” text data without having to write a script.

```bash
cut OPTION... [FILE...]
```

**Example**

If data.txt contains:
```bash
John,25,Engineer
Jane,30,Designer
```
Command
```bash
cut -d',' -f1 data.txt
```

Output
```bash
John
Jane
```

## awk

The awk command in Linux is a powerful text processing and pattern scanning tool.

It’s more like a small programming language than a simple command, designed for reading input line by line, splitting it into fields, and performing actions on matching patterns.

```bash
awk 'pattern { action }' file
```
- pattern → Condition to match (optional)
- action → What to do when the pattern matches (optional)
- If no pattern is given → action runs for every line
- If no action is given → default action is to print the line

**Key concepts**

By default, awk splits each line into fields using whitespace (space or tab) as a delimiter.

Fields are referred to as:

$1 → first field

$2 → second field

$0 → the whole line

NF → number of fields in the line

NR → current record (line) number

**Common Examples**

1. Print the first column
```bash
awk '{print $1}' file.txt
```
2. Print the first and third columns with a dash
```bash
awk '{print $1 "-" $3}' file.txt
```
3. Print lines containing a word (/pattern/)
```bash
awk '/error/ {print $0}' file.txt
```
4. Only print lines where a field matches a condition
```bash
awk '$3 > 100 {print $1, $3}' file.txt
```
5. Change delimiter to comma (CSV)
```bash
awk -F',' '{print $2}' file.csv
```
6. Count lines in a file
```bash
awk 'END {print NR}' file.txt
```
7. Sum values in a column
```bash
awk '{sum += $2} END {print sum}' file.txt
```
8.Average of a column
```bash
awk '{sum += $2} END {print sum/NR}' file.txt
```
9. Print line number with content
```bash
awk '{print NR ": " $0}' file.txt
```
10. Print last column in each line
```bash
awk '{print $NF}' file.txt
```
