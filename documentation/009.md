# Filters/ Text Processing Commands

## Cut

The cut command in Linux is a handy tool used to extract sections from each line of input — typically from a file or piped output. It’s great for grabbing specific columns, fields, or character ranges.

It’s often used when you want to “slice” text data without having to write a script.

```bash
cut OPTION... [FILE...]
```

**Example**
If data.txt contains:
```bash
John,25,Engineer
Jane,30,Designer
```
Command
```bash
cut -d',' -f1 data.txt
```

Output
```bash
John
Jane
```
