# üóÇ Linux Directory Structure and Their Functions

This document explains the common Linux filesystem structure, found in most distributions such as AlmaLinux, Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, and others.

## üìÅ Top-Level Directories

| Directory | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `/`      | The **root** directory. All files and directories are located under this root. |
| `/bin`   | Essential **binary commands** available for all users (e.g., `ls`, `cp`, `mv`). |
| `/boot`  | Files related to **booting the system**, including the Linux kernel and GRUB. |
| `/dev`   | Contains **device files** for hardware (e.g., `/dev/sda`, `/dev/null`). |
| `/etc`   | System-wide **configuration files**, startup scripts, and settings. |
| `/home`  | **User home directories**. Each user has a folder under `/home`, e.g., `/home/alice`. |
| `/lib`   | Essential **shared libraries** needed by programs in `/bin` and `/sbin`. |
| `/lib64` | Libraries for **64-bit** architectures. |
| `/media` | Temporary **mount point** for removable media (USB drives, CDs). |
| `/mnt`   | Mount point used by system administrators to temporarily mount filesystems. |
| `/opt`   | **Optional application software**. Used for installing third-party packages. |
| `/proc`  | **Virtual filesystem** with information about running processes and system info. |
| `/root`  | The **home directory** of the `root` (superuser) account. |
| `/run`   | Stores **runtime data**, such as PIDs and sockets. |
| `/sbin`  | **System administration binaries** (e.g., `reboot`, `fdisk`) intended for root use. |
| `/srv`   | Data for **services** like FTP and HTTP (rarely used on modern systems). |
| `/sys`   | Interface to **kernel and hardware** components (virtual filesystem). |
| `/tmp`   | Stores **temporary files**. Often cleared on reboot. |
| `/usr`   | Secondary hierarchy for user applications and files. See below. |
| `/var`   | **Variable data** files like logs, caches, mail, print spool files, etc. |

## üìÇ Important Subdirectories

### `/usr/` ‚Äì User Applications and Data
| Subdirectory | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| `/usr/bin`   | Most user commands and programs. |
| `/usr/sbin`  | Non-essential system admin commands. |
| `/usr/lib`   | Libraries for programs under `/usr/bin`. |
| `/usr/local` | Locally installed software by the administrator. |
| `/usr/share` | Architecture-independent data (man pages, docs, icons). |

### `/var/` ‚Äì Variable Data
| Subdirectory | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| `/var/log`   | Log files (e.g., system logs, service logs). |
| `/var/mail`  | User mailboxes. |
| `/var/spool` | Data waiting for processing (print jobs, cron jobs). |
| `/var/tmp`   | Temporary files that persist after reboot. |

## üß† Notes

- `/`, `/bin`, `/sbin`, and `/etc` are critical for booting the system.
- `/proc`, `/sys`, and `/run` are **virtual filesystems** and exist in memory, not on disk.
- File and directory permissions are essential in Linux for managing access and security.

## üêß Useful Commands

```bash
ls /               # List top-level directories
df -h              # Show filesystem usage
du -sh /var/log/*  # Show log file sizes
mount              # View mounted filesystems
