## 🛠️ Step 1: Add a New User

This command creates a new user with a home directory (`/home/username`)

```bash
sudo useradd username
```
## 🔐 Step 2: Set User Password
Set a password for the new user:
```bash
sudo passwd username
```
You’ll be prompted to enter and confirm the password.

## 👥 Step 3: Add User to Sudoers (Optional for Admin Access)
To give the user admin privileges:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG wheel newusername
```
The wheel group allows sudo access on AlmaLinux (via /etc/sudoers).

## 📂 Step 4: Verify User and Groups
To confirm the user was created and added to groups:
```bash
id newusername
```
